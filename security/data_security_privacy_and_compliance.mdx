Brixo is committed to protecting customer data and maintaining strong security and privacy practices. We design our systems and processes to safeguard data confidentiality, integrity, and availability while enabling customers to securely operate and scale their AI workflows.

This page provides an overview of how we approach data security and privacy.

## **Data Security**

### **Infrastructure Security**

Brixo’s services are hosted on secure cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our infrastructure leverages industry-standard security controls, including:

- Network isolation and access controls
- Encryption of data in transit using TLS
- Encryption of data at rest where supported by the underlying platform
- Secure key and credential management

Access to production systems is restricted and granted based on the principle of least privilege.

### **Application Security**

We follow secure software development practices, including:

- Code reviews for all production changes
- Separation of environments (development, staging, production)
- Secure handling of secrets and credentials
- Monitoring and logging to detect anomalous behavior

Security considerations are incorporated throughout the software development lifecycle.

### **Monitoring & Incident Response**

Brixo maintains monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect potential security incidents. In the event of a confirmed incident affecting customer data, we follow documented incident response procedures, including investigation, remediation, and customer notification in accordance with contractual and legal obligations.

## **Data Privacy**

### **Data Usage**

Brixo processes customer data solely to provide and improve our services, as described in our customer agreements and Privacy Policy. We do not sell customer data or use it for advertising purposes.

Access to customer data is limited to authorized personnel who require access to perform their job responsibilities.

### **Data Retention**

Customer data is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the service or as required by law or contract. Data deletion requests are handled in accordance with contractual obligations and applicable regulations.

## **Subprocessors**

Brixo uses a limited number of trusted third-party subprocessors to support service delivery. These subprocessors may process customer data on our behalf and are contractually obligated to maintain appropriate security and confidentiality safeguards.

Current subprocessors include:

| **Subprocessor**          | **Purpose**                                          |
