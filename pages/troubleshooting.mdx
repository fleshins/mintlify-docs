### I don’t see OpenAI spans
- Ensure `opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai` is installed and instrumented **before** your first model call.
- Confirm exporter endpoint and API key env vars.

### I only see a few spans (too flat)
- If using Traceloop/OpenLLMetry, ensure native OTEL instrumentations (OpenAI/HTTP) are enabled alongside it.
- Disable any sampler dropping child spans; try `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=always_on` in staging.

### My prompts are missing
- You may have content tracing disabled. In dev, set `TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT=true`.

### High cardinality / too many spans
- Start with raw OTEL only. Add semantic steps only for stable, top‑level functions.
