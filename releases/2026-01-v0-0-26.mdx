title: "v0.0.26 (Feb 6, 2026)"
description: "Team management, more precise filtering, stronger access control, and infrastructure upgrades to support scale and reliability."
---

This release delivers **team management**, more **flexible Explorer filtering**, **clearer access control**, and several migrations you should be aware of. It also includes performance and UI refinements plus internal infrastructure improvements.

Below are the most important changes since v0.0.25 (not every internal tweak, just the ones we think deliver the most value).

---

## 🛡️ **Admin & team management**

- Added a **Team section** in Admin Settings (with Members tab) so you can view team members, change roles, and remove users directly in the console. 

  → Admins can now manage access without switching tools or contexts.
- Organization **domain** is now stored, backfilled, and surfaced in the UI and access flows. 

  → Access control is more reliable and organization identity is clearer at a glance.

---

## 📊 **Exploration & analytics power**

- Explorer now supports **include/exclude filter chips** and query syntax to exclude specific values while keeping default include behavior. 

  → End users get more precise filtering without workarounds.
- New rolling **“Last year”** time range (with weekly bucketing) added across Dashboard, Directories, and Explorer. 

  → Enables longer-term trend analysis with readable charts instead of cramped views.

---

## ✨ **Smaller UX & reliability wins**

- Default sort column in Explorer now shows the **sort direction icon**. 

  → Tables are clearer at first glance—no guessing about ordering.
- Environment dropdown **refreshes options on open** (on-demand). 

  → You always see the latest environments without stale data.
- API key **created/last-used dates** use a consistent shared timestamp component (tooltips off by default). 

  → Cleaner, more polished admin UI.
- Consistent **minus/dash character** used in preferences copy. 

  → Minor polish that improves readability everywhere.
