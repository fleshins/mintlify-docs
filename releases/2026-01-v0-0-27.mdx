title: "v0.0.26-0.0.27 (Feb 6, 2026)"
description: "Team management, more precise filtering, stronger access control, and infrastructure upgrades to support scale and reliability."
---

This release delivers **team management**, more **flexible Explorer filtering**, **clearer access control**, and several migrations you should be aware of. It also includes performance and UI refinements plus internal infrastructure improvements.

Below are the most important changes since v0.0.25 (not every internal tweak, just the ones we think deliver the most value).

---

## 🛡️ **Admin & team management**

- **Manage your team in one place:** Admin Settings now includes a dedicated Team area where you can view all members, change roles, and remove access — so admins can keep permissions current without involving support or extra steps.

---

## 📊 **Exploration & analytics power**

- **Exclude specific values** **from Explorer filters**: You can now filter _out_ unwanted items (not just include them), making your analysis cleaner and more focused by easily ignoring noise, outliers, or irrelevant data.
- **New "Last year" time range**: Instantly view a rolling 12-month window to reveal longer-term trends and patterns without manually tweaking date pickers every time.

---

## ✨ **Smaller UX & reliability wins**

- **Clearer default sorting in Explorer:** The column that controls the default sort now displays a visible sort indicator, so you can instantly understand table order at a glance without guessing.
- **Cleaner API key date display:** Created and last-used dates for API keys are now formatted and shown more consistently, reducing confusion when auditing or rotating keys.

---

## ⚡️ **Reliability**

- **Fresher environment lists:** The environment dropdown now refreshes automatically when opened, so you’re far more likely to see the very latest options right away — no more waiting for background syncs.
