description: "This release makes Explorer filtering more precise and makes imports easier to monitor, review, and troubleshoot."
---

This release delivers **more precise Explorer filtering**, **faster filter search**, **clearer user selection context**, and **more trustworthy import progress**—plus **easier error review** and a few workflow consistency improvements.

Below are the most important changes in this release (not every internal tweak, just the ones we think deliver the most value).

---

## 🔎 **Explorer filters that are faster and easier to trust**

- **Filter Explorer by specific users:** Explorer now supports filtering results by individual users — You can zero in on relevant conversations and activity without manually sifting through broader results.
- **Easier browsing in large filter lists:** Account and user filter lists are easier to scan with improved “show more/show less,” and selected filters stay visible while you browse — You keep context while refining results, which saves time in large organizations and datasets.
- **Smoother filter search with complete results:** Searching within account and user filters updates options more quickly and shows matching results fully instead of cutting them off — You can find and apply the right filter in fewer clicks with less reloading.
- **Clearer user choices when names look alike:** User options include additional context (such as related account information) to better distinguish similar names — Reduces guesswork and helps prevent selecting the wrong person.

## 📥 **Imports with clearer progress and easier troubleshooting**

- **More reliable real-time import progress:** Import progress updates more consistently in real time, including status and error counts — You can trust what you’re seeing without constant refreshing.
- **Clearer import stages:** Import stages are more explicit, making it easier to tell when data is still processing versus fully finished — Helps you avoid acting on incomplete data and reduces uncertainty during large imports.
- **Download the original import file from history:** You can download the exact file you uploaded directly from import history — Makes audits, rechecks, and sharing the original input much easier.
- **Improved import table layout and error review:** Import tables are more readable, and error details are easier to review with grouped views and cleaner drill-down behavior — You can understand what failed and why faster, with less hunting through details.

## 👥 **Clearer team management and invitations**

- **More appropriate staff visibility by organization:** Team management behavior was updated so staff visibility reflects the correct organization context — Helps admins manage access with fewer surprises and less confusion across orgs.
- **Improved invite and batch-invite messaging:** Invite flows now use clearer wording, including better guidance on allowed email types — Reduces failed invites and back-and-forth when onboarding teammates.
- **Clearer approval notifications:** Approval notifications were updated to better confirm when access requests are accepted — People get quicker clarity on when they can proceed with access.

## 🛠️ **More consistent behavior in day-to-day workflows**

- **Fewer stuck imports in edge cases:** Fixes reduce the chance of imports getting stuck during analysis in uncommon scenarios — Less manual intervention and fewer interruptions during large or complex imports.
- **Actions only appear when they’re actually available:** Deletion and processing actions are hidden until they’re valid to use — Prevents misclicks and reduces confusion about what’s possible at any moment.
- **More consistent background processing:** Overall import and background processing behavior is more consistent — Improves confidence that the system will behave predictably as you work.

Thanks for using Brixo! We hope these updates make your day-to-day workflows smoother, faster, and more intuitive.
