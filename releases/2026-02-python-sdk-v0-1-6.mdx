description: "Improved reliability for async tracing and safer SDK initialization."
---

This release delivers **more reliable activity tracking in async environments**, **consistent traces under concurrency**, **safer SDK initialization**, and **clearer configuration warnings** to help teams debug and monitor with confidence.

Below are the most important changes in this release (not every internal tweak, just the ones we think deliver the most value).

---

## 🛠️ **More Reliable Activity Tracking**

- **Improved tracing in async and multi-threaded apps:** Activity tracking now works more consistently in asynchronous and multi-threaded environments — You get dependable traces even under high concurrency, making debugging and monitoring more accurate.

## ⚙️ **Safer SDK Initialization**

- **Protected against multiple SDK starts:** Starting the SDK more than once is now handled safely, with clearer warnings when configurations don’t match — This prevents conflicting setups and helps teams quickly identify configuration issues.

Thanks for using Brixo! We hope these updates make your day-to-day workflows smoother, faster, and more intuitive.
