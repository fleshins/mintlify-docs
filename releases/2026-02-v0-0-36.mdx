This release delivers **clearer left-nav grouping**, **faster access to core pages**, **feature previews for upcoming/plan-gated areas**, and **sharper in-product context** so you can move through Brixo with less friction.

Below are the most important changes in this release (not every internal tweak, just the ones we think deliver the most value).

---

## 🧭 **Faster, clearer navigation**

- **Navigation grouped by intent:** The left navigation is now organized into Dashboard, Investigate, Manage, and Brixo Agent — so teams can find the right area quicker without hunting through a long menu.
- **Key pages are easier to find:** Core areas like Dashboard, Explorer, and Live View are more discoverable in the updated navigation — so you can get to common workflows with fewer clicks.
- **More consistent sidebar behavior:** Desktop sidebar behavior has been refined to feel steadier across pages — so navigation stays predictable as you switch contexts.

## 👀 **Previews for upcoming and plan-gated features**

- **See what’s coming next from the nav:** Upcoming or plan-gated areas (like Integrations, Test Suite, Insights, Knowledge Base, Feedback Log, and Signal Taxonomy) now appear in navigation — so you have clearer visibility into what’s available today and what you can unlock next.
- **In-app feature previews:** Selecting one of these areas opens an in-app preview with a plain-language explanation — so you can quickly understand what a feature does without leaving the product.

## ✨ **UI clarity and small workflow wins**

- **Clearer current-page highlighting:** Sidebar visual hierarchy and active-page highlighting were updated — so it’s easier to see where you are in the product.
- **Faster dismissal of upgrade/info modal:** The upgrade/info modal now supports close actions via a close button, clicking outside, or pressing Escape — so you can dismiss it quickly and keep working.

Thanks for using Brixo! We hope these updates make your day-to-day workflows smoother, faster, and more intuitive.
