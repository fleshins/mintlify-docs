This release delivers clearer administration, better time context, faster exploration, more reliable data imports — plus meaningful infrastructure upgrades to improve reliability and scale as usage grows.

Below are the most important user-facing improvements since v0.0.24. (As always, this isn’t every single change—just the ones we think deliver the most value.)

---

## 🛡️ **Admin & security**

- A refreshed Admin Settings area centralizes key controls, making them easier to find and manage.
- API key management is more reliable, with smoother rotation and fewer operational hiccups.

---

## 🕦 **Time & activity clarity**

- A new time zone preference (with smart browser detection) ensures dates and times match your expectations.
- Consistent timestamps across the app now show both _when_ something happened and _how long ago_, improving at-a-glance understanding.

---

## 📊 **Exploration & reporting speed**

- Explorer tables now support sorting by more columns—including aggregated stats—so you can spot trends and compare accounts, users, and conversations faster.

---

## 🚛 **Data imports & scale**

• Historical conversation imports from CSV are now supported, simplifying backfills and migrations.\
• Bulk imports and ingestion are more memory-efficient and faster, improving reliability for large datasets.
