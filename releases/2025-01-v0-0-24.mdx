description: "Faster navigation, more predictable exploration, and clearer UI across the app."
---

This release focuses on helping you **find things faster**, **stay oriented as you explore**, and **read and understand information more easily** across the app.

Below are the most important user-facing improvements since v0.0.23. (As always, this isn’t every single change—just the ones we think deliver the most value.)

---

## **🔎 Find What You Need Faster**

- **Advanced Global Search**

  A powerful new search bar lets you quickly find users, accounts, and signals from anywhere in the app—dramatically speeding up navigation.
- **Smarter Explorer Interactions**
  - “View all” and chip filters now behave more reliably and consistently reflect your selected filters.
  - “Wins” and “Issues” are now counted and displayed consistently across dashboards, profiles, and Explorer.

---

## **🧭 Stay Oriented as You Explore**

- **Predictable Navigation**

  Conversation pages now include “Back” buttons that remember your filters, so you can return exactly where you left off in Explorer or Dashboard.
- **Persistent Filters & Views**

  Your selected filters and user-specific views now stick as you move through the app—reducing extra clicks and preventing unexpected resets.
- **Clearer Empty States**

  Improved indicators (like “No topics”) make it obvious when content isn’t available, reducing confusion.

## **🧑‍💻 Clearer, More Readable Interface**

- **Time-Aware Dates**
  - Dates now display in a simple “time ago” format (e.g. “3 hours ago”) for faster readability.
  - All dates and times now respect your local time zone for clearer context.
- **Cleaner Visuals**

  Updated icons and header layouts provide a more modern, scannable interface—making key details easier to spot at a glance.
- **Efforts & Quick Links**

  Conversation headers now highlight effort levels with color and offer faster access to related profiles.
- **Customizable Time Filters**

  User profiles let you select different date ranges for stats and charts, so you can focus on exactly the timeframe you care about.
