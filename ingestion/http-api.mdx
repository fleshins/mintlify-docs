title: Signals HTTP API
description: Send lightweight “signals” (tags) from your chat or agent application to Brixo — like thumbs up/down feedback on an assistant message.
---

A signal has three essentials:

1) **What you’re tagging**: a `message_id` *or* `conversation_id` (from your app)  
2) **The tag name**: `signal_name`  
3) **The tag value**: `signal_value`

Optionally, you can include:
- `timestamp` (when the signal happened)
- `otel` trace/span IDs (to correlate with OTEL/OTLP traces)

---

## Endpoint

`POST /v1/signals`

### Authentication
`Authorization: Bearer <BRIXO_API_KEY>`

### Content-Type
`application/json`

---

## Request body

### Single signal (recommended to start)

```json
{
  "message_id": "msg_1042",
  "signal_name": "feedback",
  "signal_value": "thumbs_up",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-03T14:22:10Z"
}
```

### Conversation-level signal

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "conv_abc123",
  "signal_name": "resolution",
  "signal_value": "needs_handoff",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-03T14:25:00Z"
}
```

---

## Fields

### Required

- `signal_name` (string)  
  A short name for the signal. Examples: `feedback`, `resolution`, `topic`.

- `signal_value` (string | number | boolean | object)  
  The value you want to attach. Examples: `"thumbs_up"`, `"thumbs_down"`, `5`, `true`, `{"comment":"Wrong answer"}`.

- Exactly one of:
  - `message_id` (string) — your application’s message identifier
  - `conversation_id` (string) — your application’s conversation/thread identifier

> `message_id` and `conversation_id` are IDs from **your system**, not Brixo-generated IDs.

### Optional

- `timestamp` (string, RFC3339 / ISO-8601)  
  When the signal occurred. If omitted, Brixo will use the time it received the request.

- `otel` (object)  
  Correlate this signal to existing OTEL/OTLP traces (useful if your agent is already instrumented).
  - `otel.trace_id` (string, hex)
  - `otel.span_id` (string, hex)

Example:

```json
{
  "message_id": "msg_1042",
  "signal_name": "feedback",
  "signal_value": "thumbs_down",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-03T14:23:55Z",
  "otel": {
    "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
    "span_id": "00f067aa0ba902b7"
  }
}
```

---

## Batching (optional)

You can send multiple signals in one request:

```json
{
  "signals": [
    {
      "message_id": "msg_1042",
      "signal_name": "feedback",
      "signal_value": "thumbs_down",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-03T14:23:55Z"
    },
    {
      "conversation_id": "conv_abc123",
      "signal_name": "topic",
      "signal_value": "billing",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-03T14:24:10Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## How Brixo uses these signals

- If you provide `message_id`, Brixo tags that message.
- If you provide `conversation_id`, Brixo tags the conversation/thread.
- If you provide `otel.trace_id` / `otel.span_id`, Brixo will also attach the signal to the matching OTEL trace/span when available.

---

## Response

### Success
- `204 No Content`

### Errors (common)

- `400 Bad Request`
  - Missing `signal_name` / `signal_value`
  - Missing both `message_id` and `conversation_id`
  - Providing both `message_id` and `conversation_id`
  - Invalid `timestamp` format

- `401 Unauthorized`
  - Missing or invalid API key

- `413 Payload Too Large`
  - Request body too large (reduce batch size or signal_value size)

---

## Suggested conventions (optional, but helps consistency)

**Feedback on assistant responses**
- `signal_name: "feedback"`
- `signal_value: "thumbs_up" | "thumbs_down"`

**User comment**
- `signal_name: "feedback_comment"`
- `signal_value: { "text": "This is incorrect because..." }`
