title: "Signals HTTP API"
description: "Send lightweight “signals” (tags) from your chat or agent application to Brixo — like thumbs up/down feedback on an assistant message."
---

A signal has three essentials:

1. **What you’re tagging**: a **message** or **conversation**
2. **The signal name**:  `feedback`
3. **The signal value**:  `thumbs_up`  or `thumbs_down`

Optionally, you can include:

- `occurred_at` (when the signal happened)
- `user_message` (a message the user may have included with the signal)

---

## Base URL

All requests should be sent to:

`https://api.brixo.com`

For example:

- `POST https://api.brixo.com/v1/messages/:id/signals`
- `POST https://api.brixo.com/v1/conversations/:id/signals`

All endpoint paths shown in this document are relative to this base URL.

---

## Endpoints

### Message-level signal

`POST /v1/messages/:id/signals`

### Conversation-level signal

`POST /v1/conversations/:id/signals`

> `:id` is a **customer-provided ID** from your system (not Brixo-generated).
>
> If Brixo cannot find the message/conversation, the API returns `404 Not Found`.

---

## Authentication

`Authorization: Bearer <BRIXO_API_KEY>`

---

## Content-Type

Requests and error responses follow **JSON:API**.

- Request header: `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json`
- Response header: `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json` (for errors)

---

## Request body

### Feedback signal

```json
{
  "data": {

      "user_message": "Love this product!"
    }
  }
}
```

### Omitting occurred_at

If `occurred_at` is omitted, Brixo will use the time it received the request.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "signals",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "feedback",
      "value": "thumbs_down"
    }
  }
}
```

### Optional

---
