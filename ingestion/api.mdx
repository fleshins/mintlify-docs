title: "Brixo Conversation Analytics — Quickstart"
description: "Brixo transforms raw AI conversations into business-ready insights — user goals, topics, friction, sentiment, and resolution outcomes — without requiring heavy agent instrumentation or observability pipelines."
---

## 🚀 Install the Brixo Python SDK

```bash
pip install brixo
```

The Brixo SDK is the recommended (golden path) integration. If your agent is **not** written in Python, see the Conversation Capture API below.

---

## 🧠 Overview

With the Brixo Python SDK, you only need to send:

- **human ↔ agent conversation turns**
- **user_id** (**required**)
- **environment** (**required**)
- optional metadata (e.g., account_id)

Note: Brixo uses `user_id` to enrich conversations with CRM attributes from your connected datastores.

No spans, no traces, no tool calls — just conversation capture.

---

# 🥇 Recommended Integration: Python SDK

### Minimal Example

```python
from brixo import BrixoClient

brixo = BrixoClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="production")

# Start a new conversation for a user
conversation = brixo.start_conversation(
    user_id="jane@example.com",
    metadata={
        "account_id": "acme-123"
    }
)

# Add user and assistant turns
conversation.add_user_message("How can I automate client reporting?")
conversation.add_assistant_message("You can upload your data and create templates...")

conversation.add_user_message("Can I schedule the report emails?")
conversation.add_assistant_message("Yes! Here's how...")

# End the conversation (flushes all buffered turns)
conversation.end()
```

---

## Conversation Object

When you call `start_conversation(...)`, the SDK creates a `Conversation` object and manages a stable `conversation_id` internally.

### Common methods

```python
conversation.add_user_message(text)
conversation.add_assistant_message(text)
conversation.end()
```

---

## Required Fields

### `user_id`

Must uniquely identify the user inside your application.\
Brixo uses this value to look up additional attributes from your connected CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.) to enable segmentation and filtering in analytics.

### `environment`

Ensures conversations are correctly grouped (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `development`).

```python
brixo = BrixoClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="production")
```

---

## 🔁 Real-Time Agents (Streaming)

If your agent streams partial responses:

```python
conversation.add_assistant_message(chunk, streaming=True)
```

The SDK automatically stitches chunks into a single assistant turn.

---

## ⚡ Framework Integrations

Optional helpers are available for:

- OpenAI Responses API
- LangChain / LangGraph
- Vercel AI SDK
- FastAPI / Flask
- Custom backends

Each helper maps your agent’s message format → Brixo’s conversation model.

---

# 🌐 Conversation Capture API (Non-Python)

If your agent is not written in Python, use the Conversation Capture API.

---

## POST /conversations (Batch Mode)

Send the entire conversation in one request.

```http
POST https://api.brixo.com/v1/conversations
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "user_id": "jane@example.com",
  "environment": "production",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "How do I create a template?" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "Here's how..." }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "account_id": "acme-123"
  }
}
```

If you do not supply a `conversation_id`, Brixo generates one.

---

## POST /conversations/conversation_id/messages (Append Mode)

For streaming or incremental submission:

```http
POST https://api.brixo.com/v1/conversations/abc123/messages
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "I'm still getting an error...",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T03:21:00Z"
}
```

# 🎯 Best Practices

### ✔ Only send what matters

Brixo does **not** need:

- spans
- traces
- tool calls
- agent internal events
- logs or metrics

Just:

- user ↔ assistant turns
- `user_id` (**required**)
- `environment` (**required**)
- optional metadata (account_id, plan, etc.)

### ✔ Use existing conversation/session IDs if you have them

If your system already uses:

- session IDs
- thread IDs
- ticket IDs

You can pass them to `start_conversation` and the SDK will use them as the underlying `conversation_id`.

---

# 🔐 API Keys

Create an API key in **Settings → API Keys** and set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export BRIXO_API_KEY="..."
```

---

# 🧪 Testing Your Integration

1. Create a test conversation using your real `user_id`
2. Open the **Conversations** view in the Brixo dashboard
3. Watch it appear within seconds
4. Explore analytics: topics, goals, sentiment, friction, and outcomes
