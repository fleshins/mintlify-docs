## What is Brixo?

Brixo helps Product, Support, Sales, and Executive teams understand what’s really happening inside AI-powered conversations.

Brixo answers three fundamental questions:

1. **Why users engage with AI agents** — their goals and intent
2. **How users experience those interactions** — sentiment, effort, friction
3. **What outcomes those interactions produce** — resolution, containment, deflection, CSAT

Brixo bridges the gap between **engineering telemetry** and **business outcomes** by transforming raw conversational data into structured signals and KPIs teams can act on.

> Brixo is not an engineering observability tool.\
> We use telemetry as an input to measure **human experience and business impact**.

## What Brixo Measures

Brixo analyzes conversations using two layers:

### Signals (what happened)

- User Goals (e.g. _Reset Password_, _Cancel Subscription_)
- Conversation Topics (e.g. _Billing_, _Technical Support_)
- User Sentiment
- Conversational Events (loops, escalations, abandonments, wins)

### Metrics (why it matters)

- Resolution Rate
- First Contact Resolution (FCR)
- Effort Score
- CSAT / Health
- Containment / Automation Success
- Deflection Rate
- Average Handle Time (AHT)

These metrics map directly to executive dashboards, operational reporting, and ROI analysis.

## Choose Your Integration Path

Brixo supports **two first-class ways** to send conversation data.\
Both are valid — choose based on how your system is built today.

---

## Path 1 — Use the Brixo SDK (Explicit Conversation Instrumentation)

Best for teams who want **maximum accuracy and control** over how conversations are represented.

With the Brixo SDK, you explicitly define:

- Interaction boundaries (one user request → one response)
- User, account, and session identity
- User-visible input and final agent output

This guarantees that Brixo sees the conversation exactly as the user experienced it.

**Recommended if:**

- You want precise resolution, effort, and health metrics from day one
- You control the agent runtime
- You want minimal inference and maximum correctness

→ **Get started:** `/quickstart/python`

---

## Path 2 — Use Your Existing OpenTelemetry (OTLP) Integration

Best for teams who already emit OpenTelemetry traces and want to **get started quickly**.

Brixo can ingest traces directly via **OTLP** (HTTP or gRPC).\
You can stream your existing traces to Brixo without changing your observability stack.

This path supports **progressive enrichment**:

- Start by sending what you already emit
- Layer in lightweight context over time to unlock deeper analytics

**Recommended if:**

- You already use OpenTelemetry (e.g. Pydantic AI, framework auto-instrumentation)
- You want minimal upfront integration work
- You plan to evolve instrumentation incrementally

→ **Get started:** `/quickstart/otlp`

> OTLP is the transport.\
> Conversation Analytics depends on whether traces reflect **complete user interactions**.

---

## Progressive Enrichment (Applies to Both Paths)

You don’t need perfect instrumentation on day one.

A common progression:

1. Send existing data (SDK or OTLP)
2. Validate interaction boundaries
3. Add user/session context
4. Add explicit user-visible input/output
5. Unlock full experience and outcome analytics

Brixo will guide you on the **smallest possible additions** needed to unlock more value.

## Which Path Should I Choose?

| If you want…                                  | Choose…          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Fastest start with existing telemetry         | OTLP Integration |
| Guaranteed accuracy for conversation metrics  | Brixo SDK        |
| No changes to your observability stack        | OTLP Integration |
| Explicit control over conversation boundaries | Brixo SDK        |

You can also **combine both** — many teams start with OTLP and later add lightweight SDK instrumentation for richer context.

### Key Takeaway

**Brixo measures conversations — not just traces.**\
Choose the integration path that fits your system today, and evolve from there.
